This movie is way to be good to be labelled a sequel to The Godfather .
Rather it is more of a companion piece to the original and the two perfectly
compliment each other . IT is both a sequel and prequel showing the rise of
the young vito and moral decline of Micheal . Both characters are brought to
life with uncanny ability by Robert  DeNiro and Al Pacino . To say that
these two are good actors is like saying that a nuclear bomb makes a loud
noise and in this movie they prove why they are at the top of their
respective crafts .Al Pacino is the standout in the ensemble cast and its amazing how his eyes
have changed from the first part . They are now cold , ruthless and
unemotional and betray the price which Micheal Corleone has paid for power .Watch this movie and learn why it is the greatest gangster film of all time.

The original Godfather is a brilliant work. It is in a sense a voyeuristic
delight, allowing us to see the mafia from the inside - we become part of
the family. It single-handedly change the world's view of organized crime,
and created a cast of sympathetic characters, none of whom have a shred of
common morality. It was the highest grossing movie of its time and Brando
created a cultural icon whose influence resonates as strong today as it
did
in 1972.As extraordinary an achievement as this is, Part II is even better. It
easily receives my nod as the best picture ever made. I have seen it at
least 20 times, and each time its 200 minutes fly by.The movie uses flashbacks to brilliantly weave two tales. The main story
is
the reign of Michael Corleone as the world's most powerful criminal. Now
reaping the benefits of legalized gambling in Las Vegas, Michael is an
evident billionaire with an iron fist on a world of treachery.Behind this, Director Francis Ford Coppola spins the tale of the rise of
Michael's father, Vito, to the center of the New York mafia. It is these
scenes that make the film a work of art. Without spoiling, I will simply
say
the Robert DeNiro as the young Vito is the best acting performance of all
time, a role  for which he won a richly deserved Oscar.The screenplay is full of delicious little underworld nuggets ("Keep your
friends close .....", "I don't want to kill everyone, just my enemies"),
while it blows a dense, twisted plot past you at a dizzying and merciless
pace. The cinematography is depressing and atmospheric. The score
continues
in the eerie role of its predecessor, foretelling death and
evil.All of this makes the movie great and infinitely watchable. But it's
what's
deeper inside this film ... what it is really about ... that is its true
genius.The Godfather Part II is not really a movie about the mafia, it is a movie
about a man's life long struggle. Michael controls a vast empire that is
constantly slipping out of his hands. He grows increasingly distrustful
and
paranoid, and even shows signs that he hates his own life. Michael almost
seems to resent the fact that he is a natural born crime lord, a man who
puts the family business ahead of everything.The great Don Michael Corleone can never come to terms with one simple
fact.... his father's empire was built on love and respect, Michael's empire
is
built on fear and violent treachery.See this movie. It's three-and-a-half hours very well spent.

You can count on one hand the movie sequels that measure up to the
original; GODFATHER II makes the cut. This movie is just as fine as
GODFATHER I. Here the director goes back and forth between the early
days of the young Vito Corleone, played by Robert De Niro, and the
family after the action in GODFATHER I in the 1950's just before Castro
came to power. Michael Corleone (Al Pacino) has moved the family and
most of his business to Nevada. Once again the acting is flawless.
Diane Keaton as Michael's wife who quickly becomes disillusioned with
her life with him and the lies he continues to tell her, assuring her
that he is going legitimate soon; Robert Duvall as Michael's adopted
brother and adviser; and Lee Strasberg as Hyman Roth all give
outstanding performances; but the film really is Al Pacino's. We see
him become a ruthless, cold-blooded killer who alienates himself from
his family in ways his father would never have done. He has come so far
from the idealistic young man in "GODFATHER I, who joined the Marines
in World War I to serve his country and die for it if necessary, to a
lonely, paranoid tragic man. There are many poignant scenes concerning
his wife and children-- the drawing his son leaves for him in his
bedroom, the gift that Tom buys the child because Michael is too busy,
his wife Kay's being kept a virtual prisoner at his orders in the
family compound, etc.Once again many acts of violence are interwoven with religion:
Michael's son's first communion, the religious parade in New York,
Fredo's repeating the Rosary in order to catch a fish, for example. The cinematography is stunning; the footage from Sicily and New York
around the turn of the century and the snow scenes from the American
West are beautiful and rich in detail. Mr. Coppola has directed yet
another masterpiece.

The Godfather Part 2 is the finest sequel ever made and is arguably a finer
film than the original Godfather. The film is divided into two main parts -
the story of a young Vito Corleone (flawlessly acted by Robert De Niro and a
worthy Oscar winner) and the rise to power of Michael as the head of the
family. Francis Coppola recollaborated with many of the crew members of the
first film and again achieves a quite superb period piece thanks to the
cinematography of Gordon Willis and set design of Dean Tavoularis. The
acting performances are outstanding, hence three supporting oscar
nominations for acting guru Lee Strasberg (Hyman Roth), Michael Gazzo (Frank
Pentangeli) and Robert De Niro (young Vito Corleone). Duvall, Keaton, Cazale
and Shire all provided first rate performances but it is the performance of
Al Pacino which steals the show, expertly portraying Michael as a cool,
calculating, suspicious Don Corleone. The film expands upon the original
movie and brings us into the family's activities in Nevada, Florida and
Havana. Arguably the finest movie of the 70s, a cinematic masterpiece with
the greatest ensemble acting you will probably see.
