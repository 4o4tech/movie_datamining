This touching and heart warming film is the most perfect celebration of the
human spirit I have seen. Andy Dufresne, wrongly convicted of murdering his
wife and her lover, finds the strength not only to change himself, but to
bring hope to those around him in Shawshank Prison.  This inspiring story
is interwoven with a soundtrack which invokes every emotion, from haunting
and chilling, to stirring and beautiful. When you go to see a movie and it
touches you with its poetry, music, and its atmosphere, and leaves you with
a sense of victorious satisfaction, it is a triumph.  Field of Dreams was
the first movie which invoked these emotions in me.  Shawshank Redemption
is even more powerful for its simplicity.  It doesn't pretend to be clean,
nor could it be called a family movie.  It is brutal and violent at times,
horrifying and sickening at others. However the title says it all.
Redemption is what this story is all about.  And it is not necessarily
redemption for the actual crimes you might have committed, but it is
redemption for the way you have lived your life.  What emerges can only be
called a maginificent piece of art.  This is what movies were meant to be.

I was a little surprised at first to see this film ranked #1 out of all
possible candidates in the IMDB user ratings. When I thought about it,
though, it made more sense--this is a "Rocky"-type feel-good movie that
doesn't really make you think and reinforces what we would all like to
believe about human nature. Don't get me wrong--it's a fine film (I gave it
a solid 7 out of 10), it's just not, in my view, up there with _Casablanca_
and _The Graduate_.<br/><br/>I guess the main problem I have with _Shawshank_ is the nature of the script
and characters. Think about it: is there a single person in the film who
isn't a one-dimensional cardboard cut-out with very simple motivations, or a
Hollywood cliche or stereotype? We have (in no particular order), a corrupt,
bigoted prison warden (who is a religious hypocrite for good measure), a
brutal prison guard, a man who is wrongly accused of murder, an old convict
who knows all the ropes and can't live on the outside, and a convict who is
murdered by the brutal guards. Now where have we seen this stuff before?
Only in a few dozen movies made from the 20s to the 90s. There's really
nothing new here. Probably this comes from the fact that the story is from
Stephen King, who doesn't really do well with complex characters (a problem
I noted as far back as _Carrie_).<br/><br/>If you want to see a good prison picture, try _Cool Hand Luke_ (from which
this movie borrows considerably). If you want an escape picture, see either
_The Great Escape_ or _Papillon_, both with Steve McQueen. Or if, by some
chance, you want a crime and punishment movie that really makes you think,
go with the late great Stanley Kubrick's _A Clockwork Orange_.<br/><br/>I couldn't stop thinking about the warden: doesn't he have a family? How did
they feel? What are they going to do now? I realize the story is inside the
prison, but I wish the movie had made better use of its characters than
simply as simple-minded symbols of EVIL or VIRTUE.<br/><br/>I'm not Mr. Cranky, I did enjoy the movie, but I enjoyed it the same way I
do an Italian dinner at the Olive Garden--a well-constructed genre product
with nothing special to commend it.

A good prison movie whose cult of fans has made it into something so
much more than it is. Greatest movie ever made? Get real. It's not even
the greatest prison movie ever made. Hell, it's not even the best movie
released in 1994! It's predictable and borrows heavily from decades of
prison movie clichés. It's also nowhere near as deep as its staunchest
admirers would have you believe. Still, it's an entertaining movie.
Nice direction from Frank Darabont. Morgan Freeman is the highlight
with a solid supporting cast. Tim Robbins, however, is borderline
ridiculous at times with his cartoonish facial expressions and silly
"stares-off-into-the-distance" moments. He's so far beneath Freeman as
an actor it's sad. With a normal movie like this, I would focus more on
the positives. I did give it a 7, after all. Unfortunately, it is
easily the most overrated movie of all time (on IMDb, for sure) and as
such the balance of positive to negative is out of whack.

I made my account on IMDb Just to Rate this movie. :-) I had heard from
someone that Tim Robins has done a great job in this movie. but when i
started watching this movie, i could not move my ass for 142 Min.<br/><br/>its not just about Tim Robins or Morgen Freeman.. its the whole
storyline,dialogs and cinematography which insist you to watch this
whenever you feel low in your life.<br/><br/>Movie has some great lines. When Andy(Tim Robins) brake the Jail,
Morgon Freeman says "I have to remind myself that some birds aren't
meant to be caged. Their feathers are just too bright" This movie has
entertainment, Feelings, Action, Drama a little comedy. In short
everything we want to see in a movie.<br/><br/>I have seen this movie around 100 times and sure will watch more then
10000 times before i die. 1 of the best movies i have ever seen in my
life.. Wish i could see that sort of movie again in my life
</p>
<p>
Probably yes, acting was good, plot brilliant, I mean Stephen King
wrote the book, but it can't match the film. When I sow this movie I
thought "thats it, this is it, best movie ever". Sure you can find
people who didn't like it, and when I ask "why", and try to guess what
then happened? They just confused themselves, they can say reason why
they don't like this movie... When I try to read comments with 1/10
star, I can't find comment with good reasons that could make me
realize, that this movie is a bad movie, If there is no reason, then
this means, that its the best movie ever made!The only reason people
are giving 1 star is that they don't like ratio "9,2", they want to do
more effect by pull this high ratio down, I really hate them :) Sorry
for my bad English language, I live in EUrope, my English teacher is
big cow with no knowledge...

I first saw this film, like many others, by chance and on DVD. And like
others, I have since watched it over and over again. When I feel sad,
it makes me feel happy, when I need hope, it gives me hope.When I want
to reaffirm my very belief in life, and all it can offer, this film
gives me a new sense of purpose that no other film has ever come close
to doing.It soars above anything any other movie has tried to achieve
in the way it touches on the true virtues of life itself. The portrayal
of friendship, the devastation of loss and the maintaining of hope.
Outstanding performances from the two leads and the most beautiful of
narratives are the tip of the iceberg of why this film is so great. The
cinematography from the very first shots of the prison are stunning and
the accompanying soundtrack add to the haunting atmosphere when we
first venture inside the prison walls. Thank you Mr Darabont, Mr Robins
and Mr Freeman. Thank you to every one else involved. You changed my
life

When I saw that the Shawshank Redemption was #1 on the top 250 movies
of all time, I thought "Yea, I could understand that". I don't
necessarily agree that it's absolutely the best, but it is so good that
it makes sense that a forum of popular consensus for film rankings
would rank it at the top.<br/><br/>It is the story of Andy Dufresne, played by Tim Robbins and his time at
Shawshank Prison. It is a perspective of what it is to be human and to
have hope for the future even in the face of insurmountable adversity. <br/><br/>It's funny, because I don't really think that any one particular thing
stands out as spectacular. The performances are very good, but nothing
really noteworthy. The characters all serve the story beautifully, but
none of them really stand out from the others. Frank Darabont is great,
the shots are exactly what they should be. Almost the entire film is
shot at the prison, adding to the feeling of isolation and routine.<br/><br/>And yet, we are captivated from the outset. Morgan Freeman could read a
Sears catalogue and I'd pay to hear it, his narration breathes life
into every scene that it's spoken over. The real beauty of this film is
it's story, mostly about Andy and Red (Robbins and Freeman), but it's
the way that each character contributes symbiotically to the
development of the story that is the absolute mastery. <br/><br/>Stephen King's novella "Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption" was
the short story that was used as the basis for the film and it serves
as evidence that King is not just a master of horror, but a true
literary genius. Sure, he doesn't use as many fifty cent words as
histories other great masters, but does anyone tell as good a story?
King always gives his writing such distinct atmosphere and energy that
you can't help but get swept away. The Shawshank Redemption is no
different. <br/><br/>If there is a film by which other films should be judged, this is as
good as it can get. Powerful, engaging, visceral, despairing, a
masterfully woven dialogue of what it means to be human. It's one of
those journeys of the human spirit that just makes you feel happy to be
alive.<br/><br/>An amazing story translated beautifully to the screen. A masterpiece,
10/10.

A friend of mine listed "The Shawshank Redemption" as one her all time
favorite movies and that brought on my curiosity what Shawshank
Redemption was, I even thought it was a typo. The next day I went out
and brought home the 10 years anniversary DVD without knowing I was
going to spend the most worthwhile 2 and a half hours of my life in
front of the TV (a melodrama doesn't kill, right?)<br/><br/>I don't know how to write a good movie review so I guess telling you
what I feel about it may do better. I remembered crying a few times,
being astounded by the plot twist for a moment or two and ending up
sitting alone, inert and all, just because of the once-in-a-lifetime
beauty of Shawshank. Just recall the scene in which Andy locked himself
in the room and turned the music on, all the cons stood paralyzed on
the ground, listening to the magical tune like the song of hope they
had never heard before.<br/><br/>Shawshank is more than a feel good movie, it's about life-changing
experiences, about the endless struggle against life's harshness and
unfairness, about true friends who will stand by you forever... The
simple yet hard to convey messages could not be handled more subtly
than this.<br/><br/>Shawshank should have won every Oscar for any categories it was
nominated, but it's all about struggling against unfairness, time's
proved its monumental magnitude.<br/><br/>Shawshank is a lesson of life that you have to learn in just 150
minutes.

I reviewed this film recently with a specific question in mind. At this
writing, this film is ranked by IMDB viewers as the second best film ever
made. The SECOND BEST EVER MADE!<br/><br/>Why? This was my question.<br/><br/>The acting is good. Robbins and Freeman are quality craftsmen in the Caine
and Hackman tradition. But these are not truly great actors and in any case,
they are only asked to play appealing persons, deliberately less-dimensional
than real (as opposed to believably hyper-real which is much
harder).<br/><br/>The director is a first-timer, and it shows. There is simple framing and
staging here. In fact, there seems to be a deliberate strategy to be as
plain as possible. And that is the core of where I think people find the
appeal of this film.<br/><br/>The story is very tight in the sense of narrative flow. All the chunks are
the same size, with no fancy rhythm. There is no distracting backstory. No
element has irony, not writing, acting, shooting, even the
score.<br/><br/>Now for me, I expect and demand art in my films -- that's why I register
this as plain. But I think it is well liked because it is totally without
pretense. It is straight and honest; people seem hungry for honesty, and
this has the appearance of what they need at just the right
time.<br/><br/>Is a film great because it merely fulfills? I hope many people think not,
and dream that this film moves down the list to be replaced with more
intelligent efforts.

........................................................from
Pasto,Colombia...Via: L.A. CA., CALI, COLOMBIA and ORLANDO, FL <br/><br/>If you have never seen SHAWSHANK, this review is aimed, primarily, at
you. I suppose there must be some of you out thereWhat is quite
difficult to fathom is that anyone with any REAL interest in Cinema
could have managed to avoid seeing it for the 20+ years since its
release! <br/><br/>In a Perfect World, SHAWSHANK is the movie of choice. What a
serendipitous confluence of diverse and inspired elements! It is the
exception that proves the Murphy's Law rule. Just look at the IMDb
breakdown analysis of the vote In every area of human activity, there
is always that "2%"! SHAWSHANK is no exception. Precisely 2% of voters
rated SHAWSHANK 1 Star! I invite you to check! <br/><br/>In our culture there is a recurring undercurrent nightmare scenario of
long-term wrongful imprisonment. Make that a Universal scenario,
perhaps, in ALL cultures. Not a SPOILER here, because this point is
clearly established in the opening 5 minutes. SHAWSHANK is the ultimate
Black/White "BRO-mance" Yet, uniquely, Morgan Freeman's character,
"Red", is anything but the "predestined to an untimely end"
sidekickThe entire film is literally narrated from Red's perspective.
If anything, Red's "Main-Man" prison status gives him a bit of a
dominant role in their relationship. But the interaction of their
characters is clearly that of 2 equals, gradually morphing into one of
lifelong best BUDS! <br/><br/>I can't help but wonder if, while cast and crew were in the midst of
making SHAWSHANK, any of them imagined the magnitude of the cinematic
milestone they were involved in! Box Office results are rather jaw-
dropping, but in a negative sense: Opening WeekendA starkly paltry
Position #144 among 1994 releases of just $750K U.S.! Overall 1994 Box
Office, did not even make the Top 50! SHAWSHANK occupied a lackluster
Spot #51, to be exact, with just over $28 Million taken in! <br/><br/>My initial interest was piqued by a theatrical trailer, but I had to go
by myselfMy wife, who is a rather avid movie goer, said"H-m-m-m-m, a
prison drama?....What's the Title?" After hearing it, she responded,
"The SHAW- What? No, ThanksI PASS!" Well, needless to say, after a
first viewing, my awe was complete and unmitigated, so I insisted on
dragging her along just days later, for my second viewing. My wife
became an instant SHAWSHANK believer. We both categorize this film in
our lifetime top 5 favorites! Perhaps SHAWSHANK got off to such an
inauspicious Box Office start for the same reasons that almost resulted
in my wife not going to see it in 1994! <br/><br/>I could literally write volumes on this movie, but, of course cannot
here! A few more highlights: Interestingly, 7 Oscar Nominations, but
ZER0 wins! Had the amazingly bad luck of having to compete with the
mighty feel-good classic, FORREST GUMP, which steamrolled that year
with 6 Oscars and #1 at the Box Office with $330 Million, about 12X
SHAWSHANK's! Wonder what the Academy's members take on this would be
today? Just look at the 7 categories where it was nominatedEach one is
exquisitely superb! Not a single Golden StatuetteWOW! <br/><br/>As far as Suspension of Disbelief is concerned, in the self-contained
and totally insulated prison environment, it isn't much of a stretch to
imagine an Old-Testament thumping warden anointing himself with almost
god-like powers! Stranger things have happened, yes? In one odd twist,
when one thinks of Illegal Immigration, Mexico, or Central America, to
the USA invariably is the route that comes to mindnot the opposite,
right!?!?!? <br/><br/>Despite having seen SHAWSHANK at least 15 times, it never ceases to
mesmerize me. My only real critique: I think Andy would have to have
been a magician to do what he did at the end, at least, so
seamlesslyCan't go into any more detail without treading into SPOILER
territory, so you'll just have to figure it out for yourself! SHAWSHANK
is truly a film for the ages! <br/><br/>10* STARS*....ENJOY/DISFRUTELA! <br/><br/>Any comments, questions or observations, in English or Español, are
most welcome!
