I don't understand how this movie managed to get to Number one on this
site. While it's a good movie with talented actors, it's just not as
entertaining and solid as other movies that i believe deserve the top
ranking. I enjoyed watching it, and it really doesn't deserve the 1/10 rating
I've given it (thats only to bring it lower on the top 250) it just
isn't as good as other movies I have seen and loved such as
'Trainspotting', 'Pulp Fiction' and 'Donnie Darko' for example. These movies are solid performances with a strong theme in one
direction, while I feel that The Shawshank Redemption flounders around
with it's, slightly lame, hope and friendship theme, thats just not as
entertaining as others.
